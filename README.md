# Weather-API

In this project I worked with Flask, Pandas and HTML to structure, process and give the user desired weather data for:
  i. Certain station at certain day, month and year;
  ii. Certain station for all years of recording;
  iii. Certain station at certain year.
  
All the temperature data was statistically processed (obtained mean value) and represented as dictionaries
